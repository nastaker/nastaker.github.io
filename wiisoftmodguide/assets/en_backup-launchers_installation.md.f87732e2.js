The steps essentially pre-download some required files which are otherwise downloaded by the console itself. These files can not be included with the installer for legal reasons.</p><p>People softmodding a Wii U (vWii) can skip these steps regardless, since the installer will extract them from the console itself.</p><p><strong>Can I use other cIOS configurations as the one in this guide?</strong></p><p>Yes! As stated above, the configurations of this guide are recommendations based on various tests by the community. They should work for the majority of cases. But you are free to install different cIOSs in different slots. We only recommend to do this if our configurations don&#39;t work, though. If you do install your own cIOSs, make sure to select a slot above 200. Also don&#39;t use slot 254 (which is BootMii IOS).</p><p><strong>Why do you install beta52 if there is also a beta53?</strong></p><p>The beta52 is overall more stable and will provide higher compatibility than beta53-alt. You can, however, choose to install a beta53 cIOS in another slot if you so wish. The main benefits are listed on the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdavebaol%2Fd2x-cios%2Fwiki%2FHow-to-choose-the-d2x-distribution-fitting-your-needs&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw27KyKOrmVgnKgfnbl1rvQ2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">official D2X cIOS repository</a>.</p><p><strong>What is the IOS base for?</strong></p><p>Since building an IOS from scratch is not very easy; the cIOSs that we install merely apply some patches to the existing IOSs provided by Nintendo for the Wii. The IOS base determines what IOS the patches are applied to.</p><p><strong>What is the IOS slot for?</strong></p><p>The Wii is able to store multiple IOSs on its internal memory, with each IOS occupying its own slot. The slot is merely a number that tells the system where to load the IOS from. For example, IOS56 will be found in IOS slot 56. In order to avoid overriding the default IOSs that are installed on the system, cIOSs (which are custom IOS and thus occupy the same slots), are installed in slots above 200, which are empty or stubs by default.</p><p><strong>What is the IOS revision for?</strong></p><p>Each IOS has an internal version number. When an update needs to be done to an IOS, the version number is increased. The system, when it detects a newer version for an IOS, will prompt the user to start a system update. The revision of an installed cIOS is thus usually maxed out to prevent the system from overriding it with a non-functional official version.</p><p><strong>What is NAND Emulation?</strong></p><p>NAND emulation is an optional feature. It allows you to load things like virtual console games from a fake NAND (the internal memory of the console). This fake NAND (often called EmuNAND, Emulated NAND) is stored on the SD card rather than the console itself.</p><p>USB Loaders such as USB Loader GX and Wiiflow can create an EmuNAND and use it to launch titles.</p><p><strong>What is the &quot;Current IOS&quot; listed on the bottom of the installer?</strong></p><p>This IOS is the one used to run the installer itself (all applications need an IOS to run). It has nothing to do with the cIOSs that are installed.</p><p><strong>Do I need to install a cIOS to use Nintendont (GameCube Backup Loader)?</strong></p><p>Nope. The cIOS is not used for GameCube backups. It is needed for Wii backups, though, and some USB loaders may need it to run.</p>',97),a=[n];function l(r,p,h,d,u,c){return t(),o("div",null,a)}const m=e(i,[["render",l]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
