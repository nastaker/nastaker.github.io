It puts the Wii into a state where it waits to load a <strong>boot.dol/elf</strong> of your choice, which is basically a program a developer writes (kind of like a .exe for Windows). These programs can range from playing media off your Wii, installing and updating IOS&#39;s, managing files on your USB drive or SD card, and <strong>much more</strong>. The possibility&#39;s with homebrew are literally endless. Having the Homebrew Channel onto your Wii will enable to run these <strong>custom made programs</strong> right off your own Wii.</p><p><a href="/wiisoftmodguide/en/how-to-use/homebrew-channel.html">More info on The Homebrew Channel</a> | <a href="/wiisoftmodguide/en/how-to-use/bootmii.html">More info on BootMii</a></p><p>This Guide is only for Wii consoles with System Menu version 4.3.</p><p>If you have a Wii with version below 4.3, either update it to follow this guide, or go to the <a href="/wiisoftmodguide/en/hacking-guide/the-basics.html">&lt;=4.2 guide</a>.</p><p>If you have a WiiU console, please see the <a href="/wiisoftmodguide/en/hacking-guide/">exploits page</a>.</p><p><u>Required</u></p><ul><li>Wii console with System Menu version 4.3</li><li>[Method 1 only] The internet channel</li><li>[Method 2 only] An SD card (Best results are with non-SDHC cards) formatted to FAT(32).</li></ul><p>Guide</p><h2 id="part-1-launching-the-hackmii-installer" tabindex="-1">Part 1: Launching the HackMii Installer <a class="header-anchor" href="#part-1-launching-the-hackmii-installer" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Part 1: Launching the HackMii Installer&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The HackMii installer is the installation tool that we can use to install the Homebrew Channel; which will allow us to launch Homebrew in a convenient way.</p><p>Two methods are provided to get into the HackMii installer.
