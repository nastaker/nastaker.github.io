This handy channel allows you to run unofficial programs for the Wii called homebrew.</p><p>Over the years, the Homebrew Channel has received many updates to keep it compatible with the Wii system updates and to add new features (like theme support).</p><p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/T5ckNZCVxSEe1_--UwVz6Ajjceo9p_b0457YGqGpkKAqo57haBSgQvi_ZtH7gDArAX3hTZGtgfpFMyW1yORx7HLco2BQ5C5Z6sLiwqATwYxM91He=w1280" alt=""></p><p>Using the Homebrew channel is simple.</p><p>All you have to do is to put the files in the <strong>correct folders</strong>.</p><p>First make a folder called <strong>apps</strong> on your SD card / USB device. This is where all our <strong>apps</strong> will be placed.</p><p>Every app needs its own folder in the apps folder. And in that folder you can place the <strong>dol/elf</strong> (the actual app). The Hombrew channel can only load dol/elf files named boot.dol/elf</p><p><strong>Examples</strong>: SD:/apps/cIOS_installer/boot.dol or USB:/apps/hackmii_installer/boot.elf</p><p>The homebrew channel will always look first on the <strong>SD card</strong>, and when nothing is found, it looks on the <strong>USB device</strong>.</p><p>There are two more files that can be in the same folder of the <strong>boot.dol/elf</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>icon.png</strong>: an icon for your app. Size has to be 128x48</p></li><li><p><strong>meta.xml</strong>: contains some info about the app</p></li></ul><p><strong>Extra options</strong></p><p>Pressing the Home button will bring you to the menu screen of the HBC. You can do the following things here:</p><p>Return - Return to the list of apps</p><p>Info - Shows some info about the HBC</p><p>Launch BootMii - Launch BootMii IOS (Only works if you installed it)</p><p>Back to System menu - Brings you back to the System menu</p><p>Exit - Shut Down the Wii</p><p>Pressing the <strong>1</strong> Button in the Apps list will give you a Prompt where you can change the Sorting method (Alphabetical or By Date) and the location of the Apps (SD, USB or SDGecko).</p><p>Pressing the <strong>2</strong> Button in the Apps list will switch the HBC to GridMode, where you only see the icons of the apps in a Grid.</p><p><strong>Themes</strong></p><p>Since version 1.0.7, the HBC is now able to use Custom Themes!</p><p>Applying themes is very easy because it works the same as with normal applications. The only difference is that there has to be a theme.zip file instead of a boot.dol/elf file. All other elements remain the same (themes are placed in a separate folder under the apps folder).</p><p>Some themes can be found <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwiibrew.org%2Fwiki%2FHomebrew_Channel%2FThemes&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw0NKOiy8QfwflRq_Jmnk3k6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>',25),r=[s];function h(i,l,p,c,m,d){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const f=e(a,[["render",h]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
