This is mainly because its the only exploit that can be launched from the wii menu itself, without having to buy a certain game.</p><p>It uses a malformed banner to cause a buffer overflow (as it fails to load the malformed banner, similar to a banner brick). Like this, it can load any boot.dol or boot.elf file that can be found in the root of the SD card.</p><p>If a boot.elf and a boot.dol are in the SD card root at the same time, Bannerbomb will fail to load.</p><p>The system menu 4.2 update blocked the old version of Bannerbomb. A new version was made that uses the same exploit, but on another place (the SD card menu that was added in update 4.0).</p><p>Since the new bannerbomb will only work with the SD card menu, it can only be used on System menu 4.0 and higher.</p><p><u>Only for:</u></p><ul><li>Wii with System menu 4.2 or lower. <ul><li>For Wii with 4.3, use <a href="/wiisoftmodguide/en/hacking-guide/4-3-guide.html">letterbomb</a>/<a href="/wiisoftmodguide/en/hacking-guide/wilbrand.html">Wilbrand</a></li><li>For WiiU, use a <u>compatible exploit</u> (or use a dedicated Wii U guide)</li></ul></li></ul><p><u>Required:</u></p><ul><li>An SD card (Best results are with non-SDHC cards, SDHC will only work on 4.0 or above) formatted to FAT(32).</li></ul><p><u>Links:</u></p><ul><li>Bannerbomb v1 (system menu below 4.2): <a href="http://bannerbomb.qoid.us/index.old.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://bannerbomb.qoid.us/index.old.php</a></li><li>Bannerbomb v2 (system menu 4.0 - 4.2): <a href="http://bannerbomb.qoid.us/index.new.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://bannerbomb.qoid.us/index.new.php</a></li></ul><p><strong>Note: The author of bannerbomb does not like it when other people mirror his links.

You will see some steps there, which you are free to follow, as this guide basically tells you the same.</p></li><li><p>First of all, we need to rename our private folder (this is because bannerbomb can only work if its the only file in the private folder). You can for example rename it to &quot;privateold&quot; or something similar. Of course you can also move the private folder to another place.</p></li><li><p>Download the first version of bannerbomb (<strong>aad1f_v108.zip</strong> for 4.1 and lower, <strong>abd6a_v200.zip</strong> for 4.2). Extract the zip file to the root of the SD card. You should have a private folder again, with only bannerbomb in it.</p></li><li><p>Download any wii app and place its .dol or .elf in the root of the SD card.
