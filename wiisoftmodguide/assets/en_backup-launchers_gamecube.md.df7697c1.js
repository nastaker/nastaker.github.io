As such, it is also able to play GameCube backups.</p><p>In order to load GameCube backups, you need an additional GameCube loader. There are various methods available; you will need one of the following:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Loads from</th><th>vWii Compatible</th><th>Extra</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>cMIOS</td><td>- Disc</td><td>No</td><td>- Supports compressed ISO <br>- Supports multi-game discs <br>- Plays backups through Disc channel (requires patched system menu IOS)</td></tr><tr><td>DIOS-MIOS</td><td>- Disc <br>- USB</td><td>No</td><td>- Supports compressed ISO <br>- Supports memory card emulation (partially)</td></tr><tr><td>DIOS-MIOS Lite</td><td>- Disc <br>- SD card</td><td>No</td><td>- Supports compressed ISO <br>- Supports memory card emulation (partially)</td></tr><tr><td>Devolution</td><td>- USB <br>- SD card</td><td>Yes</td><td>- Doesn&#39;t use MIOS <br>- Near perfect game compatibility <br>- Requires original game disc to authenticate (once per game per HDD) <br>- Supports memory card emulation <br>- Supports audio streaming <br>- Supports multiple controllers (WiiMote, Classic Controller, PS3 controller, ...)</td></tr><tr><td>Nintendont (Recommended)</td><td>- USB <br>- SD card</td><td>Yes</td><td>- Doesn&#39;t use MIOS - Very high game compatibility <br>- Supports compressed and uncompressed ISO <br>- Supports memory card emulation (partially) <br>- Supports audio streaming <br>- Supports GameCube and HID-compliant controllers <br>- Supports WiiMote, WiiU Pro Controller and a few others</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It is recommended to use Nintendont, as it has high compatibility, is easy to install and works well with existing USB loaders.</p><p>Notes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Loading from Disc</strong>: Loads from standard DVD or a mini-DVD. Multiple games can be put on the same DVD through the Multigame ISO creator.</p><ul><li>Will not work on newer Wiis and WiiU due to drive incompatibility.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>vWii Compatible</strong>: Works on the WiiU virtual Wii mode.</p></li><li><p><strong>Doesn&#39;t use MIOS</strong>: Normally, GameCube games are loaded though the MIOS. These launchers use methods to bypass the MIOS.</p><ul><li><p>Note that there is only 1 MIOS on the Wii, so only one MIOS-related launcher can be installed at the same time.</p></li><li><p>The launchers that don&#39;t use the MIOS can coexist with other launchers.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Memory card emulation</strong>: Ability to emulate GameCube memory cards through save files on SD card.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audio Streaming</strong>: Only certain GameCube games use audio streaming. An incompatible loader means the game will play, but without sound.</p></li></ul>',7),s=[i];function d(l,n,u,p,m,c){return t(),a("div",null,s)}const S=e(r,[["render",d]]);export{b as __pageData,S as default};
